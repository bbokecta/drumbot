The talking drum is an hourglass-shaped drum from West Africa, whose pitch can be regulated to mimic the tone and prosody 
of human speech. It has two drumheads connected by leather tension cords, which allow the player to change the pitch of the 
drum by scraping the cords between their arm and body.

Originating from the 18th century, talking drum players used tones to disseminate messages, such as news of ceremonies and 
commands, over 4-5 mile distances.

A skilled player is able to play whole phrases. Most talking drums sound like a human humming depending on the way they are played.

Similar hourglass-shaped drums are found in Asia, but they are not used to mimic conversation, although the idakka is used to 
mimic vocal music.

Five varieties of dùndún pressure drums of the Yoruba and the atumpan and fontomfrom of the Asante (Ashanti) are especially 
notable. They send messages up to 20 miles (32 km), where other drummers relay them, quickly spreading news.


History:

Hourglass-shaped talking drums are some of the oldest instruments used by West African griots 
and their history can be traced back to the Bono people, Yoruba people, the Ghana Empire
and the Hausa people. The Yoruba people of south western Nigeria and Benin and the Dagomba of northern Ghana have both developed 
a highly sophisticated genre of griot music centering on the talking drum. Many variants of the talking drums evolved, with most
of them having the same construction mentioned above. Soon, many non-hourglass shapes showed up and were given special names, 
such as the Dunan and the Fontomfrom.[9] This construction is limited to within the contemporary borders of West Africa, with 
exceptions to this rule being northern Cameroon and western Chad; areas which have shared populations belonging to groups 
predominant in their bordering West African countries, such as the Kanuri, Djerma, Fulani and Hausa.
